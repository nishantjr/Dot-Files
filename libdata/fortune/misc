Dr. Evil: The details of my life are quite inconsequential.
Therapist (Carrie Fisher): Oh no, please, please, let's hear about your
childhood.
Dr Evil: Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly
self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy
and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French
prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize,
he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the
question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the
sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane
lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In
the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in
a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age
of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian
named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing
like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.
Therapist: You know, we have to stop.

[T]he richer tourists at Disney World wear t-shirts printed with the
names of famous designers, because the designs themselves can be
bootlegged easily and with impunity. The only way to make clothing that
cannot be legally bootlegged is to print copyrighted and trademarked
words on it; once you have taken that step the clothing itself doesn't
really matter, and so a t-shirt is as good as anything else. T-shirts
with expensive words on them are now the insignia of the upper class.
T-shirts with cheap words, or no words at all, are for the commoners.

Information Wants To Be Free. Information also wants to be expensive.
Information wants to be free because it has become so cheap to
distribute, copy, and recombine---too cheap to meter. It wants to be
expensive because it can be immeasurably valuable to the recipient. That
tension will not go away. It leads to endless wrenching debate about
price, copyright, 'intellectual property', the moral rightness of casual
distribution, because each round of new devices makes the tension worse,
not better.

To spell out a concrete example, consider a 3-manifold M with positive
Betti number. One would like to show that M admits a map to the 2-sphere
which is "non-trivial", i.e. non-homotopic to the constant map. By a
general nonsense argument, there is a map

    f: M -> K(Z,2)

to the Eilenberg-MacLane space, corresponding to a non-trivial element
in H2(M). Since K(Z,2) is complex projective space and the latter admits
a skeleton structure with no cells in odd dimensions, we can apply the
cellular approximation theorem to conclude that the map f can be pushed
down to the 2-skeleton, which happens to be the 2-sphere.

It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by
eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the
habit of thinking of what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case.
Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which
we can perform without thinking about them. Operations of thought are like
cavalry charges in a battle--they are strictly limited in number, they
require fresh horses, and must only be made at decisive moments.

I really am amused by this turn of discussion, because advocates of
copyleft are in precisely the same position.  Their *amoral*,
objective analysis of human behavior is that some humans will try to
restrict the software freedom of others, and the vast majority of
those others will see no profit in resisting.  Therefore, a free
software license that *deliberately restricts* licensees' freedom is
carefully designed, a profoundly moral act.

In fact, even in the presence of copyright or patent, an individual
always has the right to choose only software under a free license, at
the cost of giving up proprietary software, thus preserving his own
freedom.  Therefore copyleft, restricting the freedom to bargain away
the "four freedoms" in return for something else of value, can be
justified morally *only* by reference to the software "ecosystem", ie,
emergent effects of your use of non-free software on my freedom.

Kierkegaard presents his pseudonymous authorship as a dialectical
progression of existential stages. The first is the aesthetic...stage
of existence [which] is characterized by the following: immersion
in sensuous experience; valorization of possibility over actuality;
egotism; fragmentation of the subject of experience; nihilistic wielding
of irony and scepticism; and flight from boredom.
