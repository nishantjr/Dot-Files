Setting Up Dual Monitors
------------------------

Never had issues, except for having to start fvwm twice, but in case
you need more:

Changing Resolutions and Undetected Resolutions
-----------------------------------------------

If you have trouble getting a nice resolution on your display, you
can often use xrandr between your X server and monitors to get a nice
interactive way of playing around with mode lines and resolutions and
whatnot on your various outputs. Just typing `xrandr` will give you
a list of all your outputs and the current modes available for them.

To add a new, unlisted mode to an output (say, 1920x1080 on a VGA output
where the other end doesn't give you that mode line via its EDID info),
you can calculate the VESA modeline yourself, add the mode to xrandr,
add the newly created mode to the appropriate output, and then switch to
it.

    cvt 1920 1080
    # Produces, e.g., 
    # Modeline "1920x1080_60.00" \
    #   173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
    xrandr --newmode 1920x1080 \
        173.00  1920 2048 2248 2576  1080 1083 1088 1120 -hsync +vsync
    xrandr --addmode VGA1 1920x1080
