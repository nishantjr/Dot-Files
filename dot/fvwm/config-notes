Notes on fvwm Configuration
---------------------------

If window placement doesn't seem to work, use ExplainWindowPlacement
to debug it.

You can specify the startup desktop of a program that understands
standard Xt command line arguments and X resources, e.g.:
    xterm -xrm "*Desk:1"
(From manpage, "THE VIRTUAL DESKTOP".)
